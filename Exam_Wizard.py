# Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. 
# It occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. The process involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll, the conversion of 
# carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, and the storage of energy in the form of ATP.




# What is money?
# Money is a widely accepted medium of exchange that facilitates transactions for goods and services, 
# and for the repayment of debts. It serves as a store of value and a unit of account, enabling people to trade, 
# save, and measure the value of things. 



# Reproduction is a biological process where new living organisms (offspring) are produced from their parent(s). 
# It's a fundamental characteristic of all living things, ensuring the continuation of a species.
